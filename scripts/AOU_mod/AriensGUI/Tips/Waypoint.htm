<font color=CCInfoHeader>---<font color="white">The basics</font>---</font>
For now the <font color=CCInfoHeader>/waypoint</font> command is not working propperly.
It does not give you a planet map marker, it only works if you are in the right area (Zone/PF[Play Field])

I have included a script to make it easy to post coordinates to others.
Here is what you need to do:

Push: Shift-F9
and you get:

Extended location information:
- 1114.1, 4120.7, 16.4 (1114.1 4120.7 y 16.4 670)

Copy the second line, and paste it after /MapMarker
<font color=CCInfoHeader>/MapMarker - 1114.1, 4120.7, 16.4 (1114.1 4120.7 y 16.4 670)</font>

And you will post a link in the active chat.

<font color=CCInfoHeader>---<font color="white">How it works</font>---</font>
<font color=CCInfoHeader>/waypoint</font> needs 2 sets of coordinates: X and Z (Y is height in AO) and PlayField
If you just press F9, you will not get the PF number, hence you need to use Shift-F9

Using <font color=CCInfoHeader>/waypoint</font> manually, you just need to look at the parentesis in the first line:
(1114.1 4120.7 y 16.4 670)
<font color=CCInfoHeader>/waypoint 1114.1 4120.7 670</font> will work, the thing to remove is the Y coordinate (height).

A nice feature, when you get lost while shoing your friend some interesting place.

The example place used here.. PF 670 is Clondyke
Have a look.
