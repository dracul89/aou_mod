   Notum is a mineral, with the scientific name "MTG411/6"
The first Notum found is on display near the Clondyke grid exit. There are no guards near the exhibit area, so clan can come as well.

   A rubi-Ka day consists of 27 hours
((1 Earth minute is 15 Rubi-Ka minutes meaning 4 Earth minutes = 1 Rubi-Ka hour.))

   Homo Opifex was originally developed by Omni-Tek as tunnel-runners in the Notum mines.

   Omni-Tek gets a thousand year lease on Rubi-Ka signed and authorised by ICC in the year 28'708.

   In 29'444 Omni-Tek's lease on Rubi-Ka is reduced to expire on January 1, 29550.

   Athen used to be called Omni-2
   Omni-3 was the development name of Rome

</font>Factions<font color=CCInfoText>
   <font color=CCInfoHeadline>Eco Warriors</font> Undecided in omni/clan conflict. They think everyone should leave Rubi-Ka all-together. The Eco Warriors are an extremist group headed by an eccentric leader known as 'Red', and they are most well-known for allegedly introducing the rhino-man population to the wilds of Rubi-Ka.
   
   <font color=CCInfoHeadline>New Dawn</font> Pro peace in omni/clan conflict. Probably the most peaceful of the Rebel clans, they seek peaceful co-existence rather than the utter destruction of Omni-Tek.
   
   <font color=CCInfoHeadline>Terra Firma</font> Pro-conflict in omni/clan conflict. They seek a democratic Rubi-Ka where both Omni-Tek and the clans have an equal part in governing the planet.
   
   <font color=CCInfoHeadline>The Knights of Avalon</font> Undecided in omni/clan conflict. Lord Galahad demands that they live by the ancient English chivalry code of the early middle Ages.
   
   <font color=CCInfoHeadline>The Sentinels</font> Pro-conflict in omni/clan conflict. They are pro-war and want nothing but to completely destroy the corporation. They are almost as angry at the neutrals, if not more so, for their inability to choose a side.
   
   <font color=CCInfoHeadline>The Unionists</font> Pro-conflict in omni/clan conflict. They want all Corporate-affiliated citizens exiled from the planet so that Rubi-Ka will be led by an all-clan regime.
   
   <font color=CCInfoHeadline>Vanguards</font> Undecided in omni/clan conflict. If there is a way to make an honest profit on Rubi-Ka then Vanguards and Alan Jacobi will tell you about it and tell you about how much credits they made doing it. If there is a way to make money under the table and turn an even more respectable profit doing it, they will do it. But they will not admit to it because they prefer their niche market.

</font>History of the conflict.
<img src=tdb://id:GFX_GUI_FRIENDLIST_SPLITTER><font color=CCInfoText>
   In the year 28'715 Sol Banking Corporation sues Omni-Tek to get mining rights on Rubi-Ka
   The presiding judge in the notum trial throws the case out on grounds of insufficient evidence.

   500 years later (29'203) when the Clan rebellion on Rubi-Ka starts, Sol Banking Corporation aids the clan side with weapons.

   The spark to ignite that conflict was a miningaccident. After miners having poor conditions for years a mining accident near Omni-2 happens in 29'129, where three hundred automatons, eighty-five bio-engineered non-sentient creatures, and seventy-two Atrox workers are trapped.
   The outburst of conflict came with the Omni-Tek spokesperson uttering the infamous lines "They're only Atroxes" and "We're very concerned about our equipment", in reference to the trapped miners.

   July 04 29'223 The clans are granted a limited lease on land from Omni-Tek in return for an end to all future armed hostilities and the continued cooperation with Omni-Tek's mining operations. This is the Clans Rights Treaty.

   June 26 29'475 the ICC(Interstellar Confederation of Corporations) lifts the restrictions on colonisation, and rival corporations are now allowed to transport passengers to and from Rubi-Ka.

   October 25 29'475 Philip Ross announces an unconditional amnesty for all clan-affiliated citizens. This was intended to be a first step towards a lasting peace on Rubi-Ka.

   May 07 29'479 Omni-Tek CEO Philip Ross is shot by an unknown assailant whilst making a speech in Omni-Entertainment.

   July 08 29479 With Phillip Ross still in a coma after the attack in Omni-One, and with no sign of any improvement in his condition, Omni-Tek announce the appointment of an interim CEO. Tarkhan Zora, the Unicorn liason to the Omni-Prime board of directors will assume control of the companies assests on Rubi-Ka whilst Ross is incapacitated.

   December 03 29'480 During his State of the Corporation speech, Tarkhan Zora announces that he has been assigned permanent CEO for Omni-Tek, Rubi-Ka division. The CEO effectively uses words that wage a fresh war on the clans and those of the neutrals that work against the corporation.

<img src=tdb://id:GFX_GUI_FRIENDLIST_SPLITTER><font color=CCInfoText>
This tale has circulated the hallways of Omni-Admin for years, here is how it goes:
In 29'475, few days after the unconditional amnesty for all clan-affiliated citizens was promised, Ross decided to take a stroll in the park, no security team or cameras, being the free spirit he was, he did not do it for publicity, but just to be with the people, seing his city from the street, instead of a skyline office window.
He strolled to the Rome Red park with just his personal security droid, seeing how Amicus and Animus shined in all the colours of the rainbow on puddles from the recent rain.
A young girl, troubled in the English language and with raged and misfitting clothes, approached Ross, asking him where she could find a Clan recruiter.
Ross kindly asked her why she wanted to join the Clans.
As they spoke five of the girls friends came closer, most of them young-looking, with eager faces, bright eyes and ridiculous clothing.
All except one: an Atrox in his thirties who had a simple, stylish, but also serious look, wearing a gray cloak and leather boots.
"Because we want to make a difference" one of her friends answered for her.
Ross patiently replied, asking them if they knew of the Omni-Clan conflict, and that Rome ras Omni territory.
One of the others, a man in his early twenties answered "sure; we are Omni-Tek employees, see?" showing Ross his badge.
Then the Atrox interfered saying "He thinks you’re idiots"
Ross realised that the Atrox wasn’t a fresh colonist: he had the accent of someone who had lived on Rubi-Ka his whole life.
Ross indeed did not think they were idiots, indeed they were pathetic and naive, but only misinformed.
But as soon as he had said "I don’t think any of you are idiots", the Atrox continued stating that Ross' clothes revealed him to be an Omni-Tek executive and said "You are someone quite important, right, sir?"
Being modest and a bit afraid of the situation, Ross answered that he indeed did work for Omni-Tek, but it was giving him too much credit saying he was 'important'.
The Atrox did not reply, but maintained his smirk and kept looking back and forth between Ross and the security droid.
One of the others took over the conversation, talking about Omni-Tek oppressing the free planet of Rubi-Ka.
Knowing it might not be the smartest thing, but unable to stop himself, Ross corrected the girl, informing her of the thousand year lease Omni-Tek has on the planet.
That is when the six of them started surrounding him, when he looked to his droid, its head was hanging lifeless to one side.
The Atrox waved to Ross, holding a little black box with a blinking diode in his hand.
One of the newcomers pulled a steel-encased club from underneath his leather jacket and started hitting the security droid so hard that the sound echoed through the whole park, frightening some Reets nearby that flew away. Others joined in, till the droid fell to the ground.
On the other side people passed by, but they just looked away.
Ross got frightened with the thought, that his city had come to that, a violent, dangerous place where everyone minded their own business until someone attacked <u>them</u>.
He activated his embedded communications device to contact the troops, to allow them to pinpoint his position.  But when he tried, there was only
silence.
The Atrox waved to him again, with the black box blinking in his hand.
Ross urged the troublemakers to put down there weapons and leave, but they did not listen.
A man behind Ross took a swing at him, with his Omni-issue club, hitting him in the lower back, making this elderly executive officer fall to the ground, with blood flowing from his mouth and pain shooting up and down his entire body.
He was hit again on his shoulder.
That was when the first shot was fired.
He lifted his head enough to see the first girl, the one with the thick accent, fall to the ground with a smouldering hole in her throat.
Her eyes were wide open and surprised, and she let go of her club.
She was dead before the club hit the ground.
The group fell into disarray, but Ross' eyes were locked on the sixth member, the terrorist, the experienced one. He wanted to point him out to whoever his current benefactors were, but his limbs failed him, and all he could do was croak feebly.
The man was fading away. He was literally disappearing into the shadows, Ross realised that he must have been running some kind of cloaking device, probably an Omni-Tek model, easy to detect and trace but good enough to make a quick escape from the fight with all the confusion.
Shots were fired all around him, and one by one the kids were falling over, dead. There were no mercy, not that day.

That is how the story goes, it is confirmed by internal records of Omni-Pol, but Omni-Com classified them, that does to stop the story for being told though.

The man behind the amnesty got muged in his own city, and later, duing his public speech in 29'479 he was shoot.
