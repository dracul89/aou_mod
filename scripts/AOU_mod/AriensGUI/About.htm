Why the name AriensGUI?
Well most of this tool is nothing but shortcuts to existing AO commands, with added images for quick identification.
"GUI" stands for "Graphical User Interface" so that description fits rather well on this tool.
Further more my main's name is "<a href="chatcmd:///start http://auno.org/ao/char.php?dimension=1&name=Ariensky"></u>Ariensky</a>" and that is close to the pronunciation of "AriensGUI".

The dance scripts are made by Zanthyna.
The web-page they were hosted on went down, and people had a hard time finding them, so I decided to include them in this scriptpackage.
Thank you Zanthyna
