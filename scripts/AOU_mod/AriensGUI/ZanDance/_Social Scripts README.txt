###  Social Scripts v2.0 README:  ###

Thank you for downloading Zanthyna's scripts from www.zanthyna.com. This is a list of all my social scripts and any special instructions for running them (note that social pet scripts are in the pet_scripts.zip download). Many of my older scripts have been improved, so if you have older versions of my scripts, replace them all with these.

To use these scripts, place them in C:\Program Files\Funcom\Anarchy Online\Scripts.  If there is no "Scripts" folder, you will have to create it.  All scripts can be used in Anarchy Online by typing /(name of script).  Note that some scripts (those with %t) require you to be targeting something for it to work properly.  Also, scripts with a %1, %2, etc require you to type /(script name) (word#1, word #2, etc) and thus won't work as a macro.  The rest of the scripts can be used as macros by typing /macro (name you want for macro) /(script name).  Comments, feedback, and suggestions are appreciated.  You can email me at zanthyna@yahoo.com.  

Please note that all of the scripts are copyrighted by me, 2003, 2004.  I give you permission to use any of my scripts and post them on the internet so long as you include credit to Zanhtyna for writing them, link to www.zanthyna.com, and you don't modify them or sell them.

*********************************************************************************


/1
/2
/3
/4
/5
/6
/7
/8

	These are short dances, used to fill small periods of downtime. They are designed for female characters, but work pretty well for male characters, albiet with occasional pauses between some moves.

******************************************

/99bottlesofbeer

	This is the "99 Bottles of Beer" song. It is very long and repetitive and will probably get you put on most people's /ignore list, so I suggest not using it.  Note that you can do shorter versions of it by starting with any of its subscripts, like /49bottlesofbeer or even /9bottlesofbeer.

*******************************************

/allyourbaseclan
/allyourbaseomni

	Use this to do a fairly short AO version of the Internet's cult classic "All Your Base Are Belong To Us."  There is one for each faction besides neutrals (sorry neut's) and it is perfect for tower battles after you have defeated your enemy.

********************************************

/badsmell

	A very short script about stepping in something that smells bad. You need to have someone or something targeted for this to work right.

*******************************************

/clapdance

	A very simple female 'dance' where your character repeatedly claps once then twice. This script loops and requires another script or my /stop script (in my utility scripts) to stop it.

*******************************************

/dance
/dance1

	These are female dances. /dance is my new techno style dance (which may not work well in high lag) and /dance1 is my older dance. There will be lots of pauses in them if you try to use them with a male or neuter character, so I suggest all males and neuters stick with the male dance scripts.

*******************************************

/donotusethisscript

	As the name implies, don't use it.  Seriously, don't use it.  It's a long, spammy, looping script and the only way to stop it is to use another script, like my /stop script, which comes in the Utility Scripts pack. Note that this script was designed for females, so there will be several breaks in the action if used by males or atroxes.

*******************************************

/faithhealer

	This targeted script works best for docs who have the Holy Book of the Immortal (dropped occasionally by Aztur in Temple of Three Winds) or the higher level book that drops in Inner Sanctum. Anyone can use it, but it needs a spell or buff with a good visual effect, such as 'the light from above' effect provided by 
the doc books. Just remember to only use it on a teammate if you're using the doc 
book, otherwise you can't use the book on your target.


*******************************************

/uberlongdance
/ultralongdance
/verylongdance
/longdance
/mediumdance
/shortdance

	This is a series of repeated female dances.  /uberlongdance is the longest of the group and each script calls up the script below it, so if you use /longdance, it will then automatically go into /mediumdance and then /shortdance.  These don't work very well for male and neuter characters due to the pauses.

*******************************************

/maledancelong
/maledanceloop

	These are the two male dance scripts I wrote after I found out that AO has different delays for male, female, and neuter characters. Despite being male scripts, they work good for Atroxes and even work pretty well for females.  Note that the /maledanceloop repeats endlessly until you use another script, such as my /stop script that comes in the Utility Scripts download.

*******************************************

/pee

	This is a good social script to use when going /afk. Enter your breed when using the script (unless Atrox) to make it even better.  Example: type /pee nano or /pee solitus when using it.

*******************************************

/reclaim

	This is a short spoof of the Green Day song "Good Riddance (Time of your Life)" about dying and reclaiming, AO style.

*******************************************

/zanthyna

	This gives my script web site, www.zanthyna.com, and adds me to your buddy list so that you may send me any feedback, comments, suggestions, or criticisms you have. Note that I have a Zanthyna on both main servers, but that I'm not on very often and it's best to just send me an offline /tell rather then wait for me to be on.
