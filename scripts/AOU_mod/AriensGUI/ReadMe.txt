A script package, consisting of panels with buttons to execute the most common commands of Anarchy Online.
Along with panels of various information and features for pure fun.
It will not mess with the look of Anarchy Online, but just open a window in the game.


Why the name AriensGUI?
Well most of this tool is nothing but shortcuts to existing AO commands, with added images for quick identification.
"GUI" stands for "Graphical User Interface" so that description fits rather well on this tool.
Further more my main's name is "Ariensky" and that is close to the pronunciation of "AriensGUI".
For screenshots see http://www.phuncom.com/Scripts/downloads.html as the screenshots actually fills 4 times more than the scripts on there own. Hence they are not included.
